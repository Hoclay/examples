Python Examples
===============

Most examples in this directory make use of `fakepeople.csv` which was generated 
from https://randomuser.me/

The first example uses the python standard library, the second does the same thing
as the first example but uses the very common `requests` library for python. All
following examples use `requests`.

 - Example 1 - Simplest render code (using stdlib)
 - Example 2 - Simple render code (using `requests` lib)
 - Example 3 - Read a CSV spreadsheet, and generate a message for each row
 - Example 4 - Show basic PDF composition on to pre-made stationary
